# VaultofCodes_Project
All projects which i have done in my vaultofCodes internship journey are there in this repo.


In this there are three projects :-

1). Expense Tracker : This code is a Personal Expense Tracker.
It lets you:

Add expenses with amount, category, and date.

Save and load expenses from a CSV file.

View summaries (all expenses, by category, daily, monthly, and total).

Delete expenses by selecting them.

Use a simple menu-driven interface to manage everything.


2). Secret Code Generator : This code is a Secret Code Generator using the Caesar Cipher.
It allows you to:

Encode a message by shifting letters forward.

Decode a message by shifting letters backward.

Keep non-letter characters unchanged.

Use a simple menu with options to encode, decode, or exit.
